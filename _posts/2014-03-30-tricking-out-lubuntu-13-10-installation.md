Lubuntu is an awesome version of Ubuntu. Lubuntu uses LXDE instead of
GNOME (which is used by Ubuntu). Lubuntu is lightweight and fast but this speed comes
at the cost of user-friendliness. In this post, I will describe the many ways
I trick out my Lubuntu installation to include the features I need. These tricks
worked for [Lubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander)](http://lubuntu.net/). They may work
for other versions as well. You can check the version of your Ubuntu installation by
typing `cat /etc/issue` into the terminal.

```bash
cat /etc/issue
Ubuntu 13.10 \n \l
```

Most of the time this command will work just fine. In some situations, when you are
in the middle of a `dist-upgrade`, you may get an incorrect result.

Here is a list of things I did.

1. [Aero snap using keyboard]({% post_url 2014-03-30-aero-snap-using-keyboard %})
2. [Increase mouse pointer speed]({% post_url 2014-03-30-increase-mouse-pointer-speed%})
