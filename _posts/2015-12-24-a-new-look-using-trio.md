I decided to switch the theme of my Jekyll blog from [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) to [Trio](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/trio). Pixyll is a great theme and I learned a lot from using it. I decided it was time for a change. I wrote Trio as a hobby and to learn how Jekyll works in detail.

The content of the blog is still the same. All the comments on the respective pages are preserved. The URLs to these pages should also be the same as before. I am grateful to all the readers of my blog. If you **notice a mistake** -- missing content or comments, broken URLs, images, incorrect rendering of code or anything else, please let me know in the comments below or through the [contact form]({{ site.url }}/contact/).

I designed Trio to be more content-focused, responsive and mobile friendly.
Trio specially focuses on displaying code. Trio code blocks are [clean and crisp](http://www.perfectlyrandom.org/trio/2015/09/06/code-blocks-tables-and-github-gists/). In-line `back-quoting` also looks nicer. GitHub Gists can
also be [easily embedded](http://www.perfectlyrandom.org/trio/2015/09/06/code-blocks-tables-and-github-gists/).

Trio comes with good defaults. [Markdown footnotes](http://rephrase.net/box/word/footnotes/syntax/) work out of the box. Tables are formatted automatically to have gray-white shading in alternative rows.
Additionally, Trio comes with these features out-of-the-box:

* [Disqus integration](http://www.perfectlyrandom.org/trio/2015/09/06/setting-up-disqus-integration/)
* Social media sharing buttons on every post
* Nine [color themes](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/trio)
* [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) [contact form]({{ site.url }}/contact/)
* Support for [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome) icons
* [Full-text search]({{ site.url }}/search/)

You can read more about Trio on its [demo site](http://www.perfectlyrandom.org/trio/).
