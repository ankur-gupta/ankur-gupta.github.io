[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a free, open source version control system. If you're
looking to learn to use Git, you might find the [tutorial at Github](https://try.github.io)
extremely useful. Google "github git tutorial" for a horde of beautiful learning resources.
You can also go to [bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org), sign up for a free account and
practice using a git tutorial. In this post, I point out various tips/tricks I used
to make Git behave the way I want. This is nothing new, you can find this information
all over the web. I just felt like I should list all these in one place.


####Colored output from Git

This is simple. Run this command in a terminal:

```bash
git config --global color.ui auto
```

This command will add the following snippet to your `~/.gitconfig` file.

```
ui = auto
```

Or, you can manually add the above snippet to your `~/.gitconfig` file.

####Setting up different user names and emails for different repositories

Git sets up your global (system wide) user name/email in `~/.gitconfig`.
You can do this via this command.

```bash
git config --global user.email myemail@myemail.com
git config --global user.name myusername
```

This will add the following code snippet to your `~/.gitconfig` file.

```
[user]
email = myemail@myemail.com
name = myusername
```

But if you maintain different user names/emails for different repositories,
then you need to set up the user name/email for every repository independently.
You can do this by typing this command inside the repository.

```bash
git config user.email myemail@myemail.com
git config user.name myusername
```

The default option for `git config` is `--local` so you don't need to
type out `--local` specifically.

The above commands will add the same snippet as before, but this time to
your `./.git/config` file.
