Afloat is a software that allows some Mac application windows to remain on top of other windows even when they are not in focus. Hence the name _Always on Top_. This is a standard feature for all windows in Ubuntu but in Mac we need to use a third-party software like Afloat to get this functionality. As of writing this post, Afloat is the only software I have seen that can let us do this on a Mac. If you want to learn more about _Always on Top_ or Afloat, I recommend reading my [original post (with pictures)]({% post_url 2015-01-31-always-on-top-in-macos-yosemite%}) on this topic.

The [original post]({% post_url 2015-01-31-always-on-top-in-macos-yosemite%}) contained instructions on how to setup _Always on Top_ using _Afloat_ on MacOS Yosemite and El Capitan. Those instructions have become **really old** and do not work on **Mac OS Sierra (10.12)**. This post presents a new set of instructions on how to enable _Always on Top_ in MacOS Sierra. If you have an older MacOS, please follow the instructions in the [original post]({% post_url 2015-01-31-always-on-top-in-macos-yosemite%}).

The instructions are provided as **General Steps** and **Specific Instructions**. For each _general step_, I have provided at least one _specific set of instructions_ that worked for me. You may choose to perform _specific instruction_ in different ways, depending on what resources you already have available.

### General Steps

1. Install SIMBL
2. Obtain `Afloat.bundle` folder
3. Drop `Afloat.bundle` in SIMBL plugins folder.
4. Test, restart (if necessary), test, restart (to re-enable SIP), test

### Specific Instructions

##### 1. Install SIMBL
Previously, for MacOS Yosemite and El Capitan, [SIMBL 0.9.9](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) worked but it does not seem to work for MacOS Sierra. While there could be many sources of SIMBL, [mySIMBL](https://github.com/w0lfschild/mySIMBL) works for me on MacOS Sierra and it is easy to install. Here are the specific steps that worked for me.

**Install mySIMBL.**
You can simply follow the instructions in [mySIMBL README](https://github.com/w0lfschild/mySIMBL). During the installation of mySIMBL, it might ask you to [disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208478/how-do-i-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-aka-rootless-on-os-x-10-11), which requires you to boot in Recovery Mode. mySIMBL will instruct you if you need to do this and how to do it. The only thing I have to add is that you only need to disable SIP for installing mySIMBL. Once mySIMBL and Afloat are installed, you can re-enable SIP. Instructions for re-enabling SIP are provided in this post below.

Alternative to downloading mySIMBL zip file from GitHub, you can use [MacUpdate](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/56755/mysimbl) if you trust it.

##### 2. Obtain `Afloat.bundle`
These are multiple methods to obtaining `Afloat.bundle` folder. Once you obtain this folder, I recommend that making a more long-term backup of this folder (Google Drive, for example) for future use.

**Method 1: Search if you already have it.**
You might have `Afloat.bundle` from previous Afloat installation. That bundle should work nicely. If you have installed Afloat before, don't uninstall or delete it yet. Find the folder `Afloat.bundle` on your computer and copy it somewhere safe. Some places to look for it are `/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins` and `~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins`. 

OR

**Method 2: Download from the Internet.**
If you have never installed Afloat before, then you need to obtain `Afloat.bundle`. You can find this folder in Rocky Wu's GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/rwu823/afloat/tree/master/bundle/Afloat.bundle). You can either clone the [`afloat`](https://github.com/rwu823/afloat) repository using `git` or you can download the [`afloat`](https://github.com/rwu823/afloat/archive/master.zip) folder as a zip file and unzip it. Once you have cloned/downloaded the `afloat` folder, navigate to `afloat/bundle/Afloat.bundle`. You will need this folder later.

OR

**Method 3: Build it yourself (difficult).**
You can clone the [Afloat repository](https://github.com/vjt/afloat) and use Xcode to build it yourself. Check your deploy location for a `Afloat.bundle` folder.



<br/>
##### 2. Drop `Afloat.bundle` in SIMBL plugins folder
1. Run mySIMBL using the MacOS search bar (pressing `Command+Space` and typing in `mySIMBL`).
2. Copy/paste the `Afloat.bundle` folder into the plugins folder `/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins`. mySIMBL will also provide this instruction to you.
3. Ensure that `Afloat` appears in mySIMBL Plugins window and that there is a green dot next to it, as shown in the picture below.

##### 4. Test, restart (if necessary), test, restart (to re-enable SIP), test.

**a. Test, restart (if necessary), test.**
Restart any windows on which you want to use Afloat. Click on the `Window` menu to see if you can see this kind of menu.

Note that not all applications support Afloat. I can confirm that Afloat works on [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/). Press the Afloat key (`Control+Command+A` by default) and test it out to ensure that it works. If you don't see it yet, don't give up yet. There may still be hope. Restart your computer and test again. 

**b. Restart to re-enable SIP (optional but recommended), test.**
If you have [SIP disabled](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208478/how-do-i-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-aka-rootless-on-os-x-10-11), you can re-enable it. You should do this after you have ensured that Afloat is working for you. Re-enabling SIP does not stop Afloat from working. Here are the steps to re-enable it.

1. Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting and holding down `Command+R`.
2. Click `Utilities > Terminal`.
3. Type in `csrutil enable; reboot` and press `Enter`.
4. Restart your Mac.
5. Test Afloat again.

### Troubleshooting

Restarting computer usually helps immensely with everything. Often, after a few updates, Afloat stops working for me. In most cases, simple restart fixes the problem. It's only when MacOS changes named versions that you things get really messy.

Good luck!
