This post continues my [previous post]({% post_url 2014-03-30-using-git %}) about customizing git. 

#### Shortening Git commands

Once you start using *git* a lot, you will get tired of typing out commands like, 
`git status`, `git branch`, and `git checkout` over and over again. Since *git* 
is really flexible, you can change these commands to `git st`, `git br`, 
`git co` respectively.


| Full command     | Short command   |
|:----------------:|:---------------:|
| `git status`     | `git st`        |
| `git branch`     | `git br`        |
| `git checkout`   | `git co`        |
     
<br/>
You can do these via the terminal by executing these commands

```bash
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.co checkout
```

These commands will add or edit your `~/.gitconfig` file so that it contains 

```
[alias]
	br = branch
	co = checkout
	st = status
```

Or, as before, you can edit `~/.gitconfig` to add/edit these lines. 

As mentioned in my [previous post]({% post_url 2014-03-30-using-git %}), you can choose to 
make these changes for only a particular repository by typing the above commands 
inside a repository and replacing the `--global` option by `--local`. 
Omitting the `--global` flag is equivalent to using `--local` because 
`--local` is the default option. 


#### Setting up your default git editor

Git offers you an editor to write a commit message after a `git commit` command. I never got used to 
the complexities of _vim_ as an editor, as simple as it is. Writing a commit message should be a simple 
affair which can be done within in a terminal. For these reasons, I prefer _nano_ as my favorite
_in-terminal_ editor. Setting the global default editor for git can be done by this command

```
git config --global core.editor nano
```

Expectedly, by running this command, we add the following lines to the `~/.gitconfig` file

```
[core]
        editor = nano
```
