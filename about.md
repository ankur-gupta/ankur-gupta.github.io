Hi! I am an experienced machine learning/data scientist who can write production code.
I have a PhD in numerical optimization, statistics, & modeling.
I am passionate about ML/statistics but also about software engineering.
My current interests include:
* fundamental improvements in computer vision methods,
* advanced feature engineering including embeddings,
* machine learning at a terabyte+ scale,
* fundamentally new distributed, scalable ML systems,
* use of graph algorithms for machine learning

I mostly program in Python nowadays but I have used R extensively in the past. I also write
production code in Scala using the Spark framework. Here are some of my projects (_sans_ the
machine learning projects I do for work):

* **Websites (HTML/CSS/JS)**
    - [Laplacian](https://www.perfectlyrandom.org/laplacian/), a jekyll theme
    - [Trio](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/trio), a jekyll theme
    - this blog
    - website for my [former research group](https://jbrwww.che.wisc.edu/)
* **LaTeX themes and templates**
    - [uwcbethesis](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/uwcbethesis), a UW-CBE compliant thesis theme
    - [quicknotes](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/quicknotes), a theme for writing notes
* **Python**
    - [rain](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/rain), a template python package
    - [Unbracket](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/Unbracket), a plugin for Sublime Text 3
    - [dframe](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/dframe), an abandoned python package that implements indexless dataframes
    - [arboreal](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/arboreal), an abandoned python package for decision trees
* **Assorted**
    - [r-plumber](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/r-plumber), a docker image for writing APIs in R using [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/)
    - [keyboard](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/keyboard), a set of scripts to make (K)Ubuntu work like a Mac
    - [examples](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/examples), a collection of handy snippets for Python and R
    - [numerical-software-examples](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/numerical-software-examples), a collection of examples and install scripts for numerical software such as NLOPT, SUNDIALS, and CasADi


Most of my published research involves the combination of chemical engineering with statistics,
machine learning, or differential equations. You can find more information on my
[Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pdA2f7oAAAAJ&hl=en).

On this blog, I publish articles that I believe would save someone else a lot time and effort.
In the past, I have mostly blogged about productivity improvement techniques, R, Spark, and Ubuntu.
Going forward, you should see more of the same as well as articles about machine learning
and statistics.

Feel free to reach out to me!
