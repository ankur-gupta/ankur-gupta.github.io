I am an engineer with a PhD in *Chemical Engineering*. But I work with mathematics and computers. I live in San Francisco.

On this website, I aim to add interesting content that you cannot find otherwise on the internet. In other words, every time I have to figure out something new that wasn't previously there on the internet, I put the information up here.

You can expect to find *computer-y* things here. Mathematical and logical things will also find their way on this site.

You can find me on [GitHub](http://github.com/ankur-gupta/) or my [former research group](http://jbrwww.che.wisc.edu/projects/ankur/index.html) or on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ankurguptawisc).
